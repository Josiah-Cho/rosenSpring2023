# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I haven't thought of a title yet but it will probably be the side scrolling game.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A side scrolling game where you have to fight enemies and reach a goal.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The character would probably be a stick figure. The mechanics would be like your typically beat 'em up game. You can move your character and punch the enemies, there will be health bars, and you will scroll there the game until you defeat all the enemies.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Not applicable.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I would, at least, like motion mechanics done, such as walking, jumping, and punching. Also, I would like to have the layout of the map finished.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be having enemies that randomly walk around and attack my character. Also, having the health bars.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best is not only having a completed game, but a more complex background and character design.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Well, I never created a game, so I need to learn to used the correct engines like Unreal. Also, I need to check out the "Game" tab under Module 11.
Also, I am working alone so the last question doesn't apply.
